    <h1>Understanding Data Distribution: Mean and Median</h1>

    <div class="figure">

        <p class="caption">Figure 1: Distribution of Data with Mean and Median</p>
    </div>

    <p>Figure 1 illustrates a right-skewed distribution of data, along with its mean and median. This type of visualization is crucial for understanding the central tendency and overall shape of a dataset.</p>

    <div class="explanation">
        <h3>Key Observations:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="key-point">Right-skewed Distribution:</span> The bulk of the data is concentrated on the left side, with a longer "tail" extending to the right.</li>
            <li><span class="key-point">Mean vs. Median:</span> The mean (12.90) is slightly higher than the median (12.00), which is typical for right-skewed distributions.</li>
            <li><span class="key-point">Data Range:</span> Values range from about 0 to 30, with most data points clustered between 0 and 20.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>Interpretation:</h3>
    <p>In a right-skewed distribution:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The mean is typically higher than the median because it's influenced by the extreme values in the right tail.</li>
        <li>The median is less affected by these extreme values, making it often a better representation of the "typical" value in skewed datasets.</li>
        <li>The difference between mean and median can be used as a rough indicator of the degree of skewness.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>This pattern is common in real-world scenarios, such as income distributions or certain biological measurements, where most values cluster around a lower range, but a few high values pull the mean upward.</p>

    <div class="explanation">
        <h3>Implications:</h3>
        <p>Understanding the relationship between mean, median, and distribution shape is crucial for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Choosing appropriate measures of central tendency</li>
            <li>Interpreting data correctly across various fields</li>
            <li>Making informed decisions about statistical analyses and data presentation</li>
        </ul>
